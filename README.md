# Downloading stock market data via API

This repository demonstrates how to download stock market data via an API. The setup is configured to automatically download the data daily and store it accordingly.

This endeavor has been achieved using three different methods:

1. On a web-based platform using pre-built services (no coding required)
2. On a pre-configured development environment (involving coding)
3. On an extensive cloud computing platform (involving coding)

All three approaches involve downloading the same data from the market data provider [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/#page-top). It is therefore important that you apply for an API Key from Alpha Vantage before you start with one of the three use cases. How to request a API key is described in the [Alpha Vantage](00-Alpha_Vantage) folder.

In terms of complexity, the first case is the easiest method to implement and the third case is the most complex. The process of setting up each of these methods is detailed in this repository.

### Enjoy trying it out!
