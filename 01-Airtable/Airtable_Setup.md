When a new base is opened, Airtable creates an Excel-like interface with a table. In the first column of the table, the symbols of the respective shares of which you want to build a history can be entered. How to determine the symbols of the respective shares is described under [Alpha-Vantage_Stock Selection](../00-Alpha_Vantage/Alpha-Vantage_Stock-Selection.md).
