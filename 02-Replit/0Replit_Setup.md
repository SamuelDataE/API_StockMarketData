# Setup


### Replit
<br><br>
Open an account with Replit - you can do this under the following [link](https://replit.com/login). Enter your details - the login process should be self-explanatory.

After you have registered, you will see this screen. To start the project you have to create your first Repl (short for "Read-Eval-Print Loop"). Click on **Create Repl**.

A new windows opens. 
1. Select Python as a template
2. Name your Repl
3. Decide if you want to have a private or public Repl
   Difference:
   For a public Repl, other users can see your code, but they cannot directly modify it. However, they can create their own copy (Fork) of the Repl and make changes to that copy without affecting your original code.
   With a private Repl, no one except you (or those you explicitly grant access to) can see or modify the code. For a private Repl, you must have a paid user subscription.
4. **Create Repl**

Once you have created your Repl, the following screen appears in which you manage your Repl.There are for different sections:
 * Files
 * Tools
 * Script (main.py)
 * Console

<br><br><br><br>

Before we start writing the Python script, we first create some support files that are necessary for the script to run. On the left side next to **Files** it has a **+** sign. Click on this sign and create a new file with the name **config.txt**.

Open this new file and enter in the code section ```API_KEY=``` as well as your personal API Key from Alpha Vantage. How to request that Key is described [here](../00-Alpha_Vantage/Alpha-Vantage_General-Information.md). In my case, the input looks like this: API_KEY=0KNPGB95CEUWLYR7
